 * Lock request types:
 *   LK_SHARED - get one of many possible shared locks. If a process
 *	holding an exclusive lock requests a shared lock, the exclusive
 *	lock(s) will be downgraded to shared locks.
 *   LK_EXCLUSIVE - stop further shared locks, when they are cleared,
 *	grant a pending upgrade if it exists, then grant an exclusive
 *	lock. Only one exclusive lock may exist at a time, except that
 *	a process holding an exclusive lock may get additional exclusive
 *	locks if it explicitly sets the LK_CANRECURSE flag in the lock
 *	request, or if the LK_CANRECUSE flag was set when the lock was
 *	initialized.
 *   LK_UPGRADE - the process must hold a shared lock that it wants to
 *	have upgraded to an exclusive lock. Other processes may get
 *	exclusive access to the resource between the time that the upgrade
 *	is requested and the time that it is granted.
 *   LK_EXCLUPGRADE - the process must hold a shared lock that it wants to
 *	have upgraded to an exclusive lock. If the request succeeds, no
 *	other processes will have gotten exclusive access to the resource
 *	between the time that the upgrade is requested and the time that
 *	it is granted. However, if another process has already requested
 *	an upgrade, the request will fail (see error returns below).
 *   LK_DOWNGRADE - the process must hold an exclusive lock that it wants
 *	to have downgraded to a shared lock. If the process holds multiple
 *	(recursive) exclusive locks, they will all be downgraded to shared
 *	locks.
 *   LK_RELEASE - release one instance of a lock.
 *   LK_DRAIN - wait for all activity on the lock to end, then mark it
 *	decommissioned. This feature is used before freeing a lock that
 *	is part of a piece of memory that is about to be freed.
 *
 * These are flags that are passed to the lockmgr routine.
